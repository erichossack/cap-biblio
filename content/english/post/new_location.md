We are looking to partner with Eglise Baptiste De Bayeux as they construct a new sanctuary. We will be funding an archive to store our bibles and historical artifacts. We hope you will be interested in partnering with us in this endeavor by helping to fund construction of the archive room.

This space will be climate controlled and will aid us in keeping our various materials in good condition so that we can continue to exhibit them for many years to come!

If you'd like to assist us in making this possible [please visit our donation page by clicking here](../donate/index.md) or accessing it from the menu bar.
